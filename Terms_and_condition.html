          <h3>General</h3>
          <p>
            Wordoid is a service for self-expression and communication. We believe that Wordoid increases the availability of information, encourages healthy debate and makes possible new connections between people. 

However, in order to uphold these values, we need to curb abuse that threatens our ability to provide this service and the freedom of expression that it encourages. As a result, there are some boundaries on the type of content that can be hosted with Wordoid. The boundaries that we've defined are those that serve to enhance the service as a whole.

                <li>We do not allow illegal sexual content, including image, video or textual content that depicts or encourages rape, incest, bestiality or necrophilia.</li>

          <h3>Harrasment bullying and stress</h3>
          <p>
            Do not harass, bully or threaten others. We also don’t allow this product to be used to engage or incite others in these activities. This includes singling someone out for malicious abuse, threatening someone with serious harm, sexualising someone in an unwanted way, exposing private information of someone else that could be used to carry out threats, disparaging or belittling targets of violence or tragedy, inciting others to carry out these activities or harassing someone in other ways. Keep in mind that online harassment is illegal in many places and can have serious offline consequences for both the harasser and the target. We may take appropriate action if we are notified of threats of harm or other dangerous situations, which may include reporting you to the relevant authorities.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Impersonations and misrepresentation of identity</h3>
          <p>
            Do not impersonate a person or organisation or misrepresent yourself. This includes impersonating any person or organisations that you don’t represent or providing misleading information about a user/site’s identity, qualifications, ownership, purpose, products, services or business.
            This also includes content or accounts misrepresenting or concealing their ownership or primary purpose such as misrepresenting or intentionally concealing your country of origin or other material details about yourself when directing content about politics, social issues or matters of public concern to users in a country other than your own. We do allow parody, satire and the use of pseudonyms or pen names – just avoid content that is likely to mislead your audience about your true identity.
